# pyTCSPC

## a set of Python functions for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and similar techniques:

### FLIM functions
- read Becker &amp; Hickl .sdt files (from Gohlke lab, UC Irvine)
- produce intensity images
- fit decay curves
- perform flux inference using NADH FLIM data (as described in Yang *et al.*, *eLife*, 2021)


### FCS functions
